# üöÄ Backend Deployment Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DECISION FIRST!

### Your Backend Uses Socket.IO
- [ ] **Decision Made:** Which platform will you use?
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Railway (RECOMMENDED)** - Full Socket.IO support
  - [ ] ‚ùå **Vercel** - Socket.IO won't work (not recommended)
  - [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Render** - Works but free tier has cold starts
  - [ ] Other: _____________

**If you chose Railway, follow Railway checklist below.**  
**If you chose Vercel, follow Vercel checklist below.**

## üìã Vercel Deployment Checklist (NOT RECOMMENDED)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- [ ] **I understand Socket.IO will NOT work on Vercel**

- [ ] **I have a plan to handle this (remove Socket.IO or use alternative)**

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas is set up
- [ ] All environment variables ready
- [ ] Socket.IO features are disabled/removed (if applicable)

### Installation
- [ ] Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
- [ ] Login to Vercel: `vercel login`
- [ ] Navigate to server directory

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy: `vercel --prod`
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test REST API endpoints

### Environment Variables
(Same list as Railway above)

### Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Test REST API endpoints
- [ ] ‚ùå Socket.IO won't work (expected)
- [ ] Test authentication
- [ ] Test database operations
- [ ] Test file uploads (4.5MB limit)
- [ ] Check function timeout (10s on free tier)

### Known Limitations on Vercel
- ‚ùå No Socket.IO support
- ‚ùå No WebSockets
- ‚ùå 10-second timeout on free tier
- ‚ùå 4.5 MB request limit
- ‚ùå Cold starts after inactivity
- ‚ùå No background jobs
- ‚ùå No persistent connections
