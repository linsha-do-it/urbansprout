# 🌱 UrbanSprout Backend Deployment - START HERE

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFORMATION

### Your Backend Uses Socket.IO!

Your backend uses **Socket.IO** for real-time features like:
- 📡 Real-time notifications
- 💬 Live chat/chatbot
- 🔄 Live updates

**This means:**
- ✅ **Railway** - Will work perfectly (RECOMMENDED)
- ❌ **Vercel** - Will NOT work (Socket.IO not supported)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (Choose One)

### Option 1: Railway (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Why:** Full Socket.IO support, all features work!

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Navigate to server
cd "/Users/linsha/Desktop/FINAL DRAFT OF PROJECT/UrbanSprout-main  Hosting/server"

# 3. Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up

# 4. Get your URL
railway domain
```

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cost:** Free ($5 credit/month)  
**Socket.IO:** ✅ Works perfectly

---

### Option 2: Vercel (NOT RECOMMENDED) ⚠️

**Why:** Socket.IO won't work, real-time features will break!

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Navigate to server
cd "/Users/linsha/Desktop/FINAL DRAFT OF PROJECT/UrbanSprout-main  Hosting/server"

# 3. Login and deploy
