## Deployment Architecture Recommendation

### Option 1: All-In-One (Recommended for Start)

Frontend (Vercel) → Backend (Railway)
                     ↓
                 MongoDB Atlas
```
**Pros:** Simple, easy to manage, good performance  
**Cost:** ~$5-10/month total

---

### Option 2: Separate Services (For Scale)
```
Frontend (Vercel)
    ↓
API (Railway) → MongoDB Atlas
    ↓
Socket.IO (Railway)
```
**Pros:** Can scale independently  
**Cost:** ~$15-30/month

---

### Option 3: Full Cloud (Enterprise)
```
Frontend (Vercel/CloudFlare)
    ↓
Load Balancer (AWS)
    ↓
API Servers (Railway/ECS) → MongoDB Atlas/DocumentDB
    ↓
Cache (Redis)
```
**Pros:** Maximum scalability and performance  
**Cost:** $100-500+/month

---

## Quick Start: My Recommended Setup

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway
```bash
cd server
railway login
railway init
railway up
