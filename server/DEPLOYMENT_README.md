# UrbanSprout Backend Deployment

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Your Backend Uses Socket.IO!

**Vercel does NOT support Socket.IO!** Your real-time features (notifications, chat, live updates) will NOT work on Vercel.

### ✅ Recommended: Use Railway Instead
Railway fully supports Socket.IO and all your backend features.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Railway (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login
railway login

# 3. Initialize and deploy
railway init
railway up

# 4. Get your URL
railway domain
```

**That's it!** Your backend is live with full Socket.IO support.
